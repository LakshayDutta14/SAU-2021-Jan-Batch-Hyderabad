#Flyweight Design Pattern 

It is used when we want to create large number of similar objects.

for example - let us take a program where we have to generate sqaures of different colors.Now instead of creating differnet 
objects for sqaure of each color we create an common object which has the properties of square(like side) and pass the color from outside to it
through an array.So this helps us to save our RAM.

This pattern reduces number of objects created and hence decreases memory requirements.

Attached above is the program created to generate sqaures of different colors instead of creating different objects for different colored squares.
